**Folder Description**
- Run 'python main.py' from directory to run training and evaluation on diffusion models and GANs
- diffusion.py, model.py ema.py, and utils.py are all used in designing, training, and using diffusion models
- classifier.py and gan.py are for GAN models
- evaluate.py has various evaluation functions
- /models contains some trained diffusion models
- /gan contains some trained GANs
- /results contains some saved evaluation plots
- /classifier_data contains some saved quantitative metrics
